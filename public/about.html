  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <h2>Hi, I’m Etti.</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a Technical & UX Writer with a deep curiosity for how people and technology interact. I believe great writing is more than just words on a page—it’s a bridge between complex systems and human understanding. Whether it’s API docs or onboarding flows, I aim to make every experience clear, intuitive, and genuinely helpful.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    My work lives at the intersection of user empathy and technical depth. I specialize in crafting documentation that empowers users—from developers working with APIs to customers trying to understand a product for the first time. I obsess over structure, voice, and accessibility, and I approach each project with the mindset of a UX designer: focused on clarity, context, and usability.
  </p>

  <h2>Why I’m Learning to Code</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve always worked closely with engineers, but I wanted to go a step further: to truly understand how the systems I write about are built. Learning to code helps me speak the same language as my collaborators—and ask better questions. It sharpens my writing and gives me new ways to advocate for users.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s not just about building things (though that’s fun too); it’s about becoming a more informed, technical writer—someone who can translate complexity into confidence.
  </p>

  <h2>What I’m Learning</h2>
  <p>
    I’m currently focused on the foundations of front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goals include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating interactive, user-friendly documentation and demos</li>
    <li>Building small tools to streamline writing and review workflows</li>
    <li>Developing a deeper understanding of the developer experience</li>
    <li>Bridging communication gaps between dev, design, and content teams</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm driven by a desire to make information accessible, approachable, and meaningful. I love finding elegant ways to explain difficult concepts—and I get excited when a user finds exactly what they need, when they need it.
